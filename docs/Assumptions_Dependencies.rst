This chapter contains limitations on the scope of the document.

Assumptions
-----------

An L1 with a proprietary interface and a testmac supporting the FAPI interface are available through the Open Source Community(OSC) github in binary blob form and with the reference
files that support the tests required for the current O-RAN Release. The required header files that are needed to build the 5G FAPI TM and to run validation tests and to integrate with the O-DU
High to check network functionality are available from the same site.
The L1 App and Testmac repository is at https://github.com/intel/FlexRAN/


Requirements
------------
* Only Xeon速 series Processor with Intel Architecture are supported and the platform should be either Intel速 Xeon速 SkyLake or CascadeLake with at least 2.0 GHz core frequency.
* FPGA/ASIC card for FEC acceleration that is compliant with the BBDev framework and interface. Only needed to run high throughput cases with the HW FEC card assistance.
* Bios setting steps and options may have differences, however at least you should have the same Bios setting as decribed in the README.md file available at https://github.com/intel/FlexRAN Bios settings section.
* Running with FH requires PTP for Linux\* version 2.0 (or later) to be installed to provide IEEE 1588 synchronization.


Dependencies
------------

O-RAN library implementation depends on the Data Plane Development Kit
(DPDK v20.11.3).

DPDK v20.11.3 should be patched with corresponding DPDK patch provided
with FlexRAN release (see *Table 1*, FlexRAN Reference Solution Software
Release Notes)

Intel OneApi DPC++/C++ Compiler is used. Version 2022.0.0 or newer.

Intel速 C++ Compiler v19.0.3 can also be used but not verified with the f release.

-  Optionally Octave v3.8.2 can be used to generate reference IQ samples (octave-3.8.2-20.el7.x86_64).

Constraints
-----------

This release has been designed and implemented to support the following
numerologies defined in the 3GPP specifications for LTE and 5GNR (refer
to *Table 2*):

5G NR
~~~~~

Category A support:

-  Numerology 0 with bandwidth 5/10/20 MHz with up to 12 cells in 2x2 antenna configuration
-  Numerology 0 with bandwidth 40 MHz with 1 cell.

-  Numerology 1 with bandwidth 20/40 MHz with 1 cell and URLLC use cases for 40 MHz
-  Numerology 1 with bandwidth 100 MHz with up to 16 cells

-  Numerology 3 with bandwidth 100 MHz with up to 3 cells

Category B support:

Numerology 1 with bandwidth 100 MHz where the antenna panel is up to
64T64R with up to 3 cells.

LTE
~~~

Category A support:

Bandwidth 5/10/20 MHz with up to 12 cells

Category B support:

Bandwidth 5/10/20 MHz for 1 cell

The feature set of O-RAN protocol should be aligned with Radio Unit
(O-RU) implementation. Inter-operability testing (IoT) is required to
confirm the correctness of functionality on both sides. The exact
feature set supported is described in Chapter *4.0* *Transport Layer and
O-RAN Fronthaul Protocol Implementation* of this document.
