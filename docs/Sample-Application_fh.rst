Figure 26. Sample Application

The sample application was created to execute test scenarios with
features of the O-RAN library and test external API as well as timing.
The sample application is named sample-app, and depending on
configuration file settings can act as O-DU or simplified simulation of
O-RU. The first O-DU should be run on the machine that acts as O-DU and
the second as O-RU. Both machines are connected via ETH. The sample
application on both sides executes using a constant configuration
according to settings in corresponding config files
(./app/usecase/mu0_10mhz/config_file_o_du.dat and
./app/usecase/mu0_10mhz/config_file_o_ru.dat) and uses binary files
(ant.bin) with IQ samples as input. Multiple-use cases for different
numerologies and different BW are available as examples. Configuration
files provide descriptions of each parameter, and in general, those are
related to M-plane level settings as per the O-RAN Fronthaul
specification, refer to *Table 2*.

From the start of the process, the application (O-DU) sends DL packets
for the U-plane and C-plane and receives U-plane UL packets.
Synchronization of O-DU and O-RU sides is achieved via IEEE 1588.

U-plane packets for UL and DL direction are constructed the same way
except for the direction field.

One_way Delay Measurements:
---------------------------

There are 4 usecases defined that are based on cat a, numerology 0 and
20 MHz Bw:

Common to all cases the following parameters are needed in the
usecase_xu.cfg files where x=r for ORU and x=d for ODU.

oXuOwdmNumSamps=8 # Run 8 samples per port

oXuOwdmFltrType=0 # Simple average

oXuOwdmRespTimeOut=10000000 # 10 ms expressed in ns (Currently not
enforced)

oXuOwdmMeasState=0 # Measurement state is INIT

oXuOwdmMeasId=0 # Measurement Id seed

oXuOwdmEnabled=1 # Measurements are enabled

oXuOwdmPlLength= n # with 40 <= n <= 1400 bytes

For the ORU

oXuOwdmInitEn=0 #O-RU is always the recipient

For the ODU

oXuOwdmInitEn=1 #O-DU is always initiator

20 Corresponds to the Request/Response usecase with Payload Size 40
bytes

oXuOwdmMeasMeth=0 # Measurement Method REQUEST

21 Corresponds to the Remote Request usecase with Payload Size 512 bytes

oXuOwdmMeasMeth=1 # Measurement Method REM_REQ

22 Corresponds to the Request with Follow Up usecase with Payload Size
1024 bytes

oXuOwdmMeasMeth=2 # Measurement Method REQUESTwFUP

23 Corresponds to the Remote Request with Follow Up usecase with default
Payload Size

oXuOwdmMeasMeth=3 # Measurement Method REM_REQ_WFUP
